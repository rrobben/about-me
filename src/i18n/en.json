            "EasyOpp": "Designing and developing ERP software in a product development team. Two of our main applications include mobile PWA which is used by employees of our customers to log, edit and view their work-hours and related information. And a Desktop web app which includes e.g. approving work-hours, transfering salaries to integration and other administrative features like configuration of work-hour and salary calculation.<br /><br />I had the main responsibility when we implemented the new mobile UI (ReactJS + TypeScript) from scratch. Creating a base to start building the application, implementing core features and generic components as well as reviewing other people's work. I also did the infrastructure setup for Azure deployment.<br /><br />I've also had the responsibility to be designing the renewal of our salary calculation process including the underlying data model improvements and how the process could be made easier for the user and how these two aspects would integrate together.<br /><br />As a Senior Developer I have had the opportunity to mentor Junior Developers to share my knowledge and help them with different aspects of their work from which I have gotten positive feedback.<br /><br />The main technologies in use are React + TypeScript, C# + .NET, MSSQL and Azure. I have also done some maintenance for existing E2E tests using Robot Framework with Playwright.",
            "Adalia": "Designing and developing web applications both in customer projects in different industries and developing our own Monitoring and Evaluation system.<br /><br />I had the chance to start the implementation of a completely new system to replace the old one for one customer. Creating the application structure (React + Rails), designing data model and implementing user and permission management to provide basis for other people to join development.<br /><br />For one of our customer projects I implemented offline functionalities to allow the data to be saved whilst the user is offline and synchronization to the server once the user had the network connection again. I also did my master's thesis on this specific subject which included some additional research on the subject such as using service workers to cache application content in the browser.<br /><br />Starting as Junior Developer my responsibilities grew over my time at Adalia meaning I would also get to mentor new Junior Developers who joined after me. This also meant that for some projects I was the sole developer responsible for maintenance and had multiple projects at the same time.<br /><br />Mostly used technologies were Ruby on Rails, React and PostgreSQL. I also did configurations for services to be run on AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda and worked on a Node.js API.",
